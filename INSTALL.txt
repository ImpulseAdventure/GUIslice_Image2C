Install instructions
====================

you need to either install Java JRE or use Arduino's IDE 1.87 which ALREADY contains Java 8 JRE

Windows 64-bit
==============

If you are using Arduino IDE's Java skip ahead to Windows Install.

To download Java 8 you must use Oracle's JRE.  No JRE binaries are available from the OpenJDK site.

Oracle's latest version is 192 and the site is:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

You then need to run the downloaded file:
jre-8u192-windows-x64.exe

Windows Install
===============
Download the latest image2c from github
Then unzip guislice_image2c-win-n.nn.zip in whatever folder is you desire.

If you already have the system environment variable JAVE_HOME set
you can simply run the image2c.bat file.

If not, edit the image2c.bat file to point to your java installation.
change line 2 from:
REM set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java"
to whatever folder has java installed. For example
set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_192\Java"
or for Arduino's IDE
set JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\java"

Don't forget the quotes.

WINDOWS RUN GUISLICE IMAGE2C
===================
You can now run image2c using the bat script.
image2c.bat

LINUX
=====

During installation You simply need to verify a version of java is installed.
image2c is built using Java 1.8 but should run with the latest code.

from a command window type:
java -version

If that works go LINUX DOWNLOAD GUISLICE IMAGE2C.  

If it turns out no java is installed it will likely inform you of what commands 
to use to install java.

If not, You can download Java JRE by using:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install default-jre

Again verify with:
java -version

LINUX DOWNLOAD GUISLICE IMAGE2C
======================
Download the latest image2c from github
Then unpack guislice_image2c-linux-n.nn.tar.gz in whatever folder is you desire.
tar xvzf guislice_image2c-linux-n.nn.tar.gz

Again it really doesn't matter what version you are running.
There is no need to edit the image2c.sh script.

LINUX run the image2c
=====================
./image2c.sh

MacOS DOWNLOAD GUISLICE IMAGE2C
======================
Download the latest image2c from github
Then unzip GUIslice_image2c-osx-n.nn.zip in whatever folder is you desire.

You should be able to simply double click on the jar file.
